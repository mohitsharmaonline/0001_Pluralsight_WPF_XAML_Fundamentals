            <!--Property Element Syntax: So if
            I create an element 
            with a dot in the name like this,
            XAML interprets the bit before the
            dot as a class name and then the 
            part after the dot as a property
            name. So I'm telling XAML I'd like 
            to set the button's template 
            property here. So it won't
            interpret this as being normal 
            content of the button it will 
            understand that what goes inside
            of here is actually a value for the 
            property. And now, I can put any
            object I like in here as the XAML, 
            or at least that's what the XAML
            syntax means. This particular 
            property needs to be a particular 
            type which is control template.-->
            <Button.Template>
                <!--Now control templates need
                to be told what their target 
                type is, so this needs to know 
                that it's the template for a 
                button. This may seem slightly 
                odd because you might think it 
                could work it out from the
                context, however, normally 
                control templates are defined 
                externally to the controls
                themselves. -->

                    TargetType="Button">

            </Button.Template>
